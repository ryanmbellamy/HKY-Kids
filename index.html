            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>We aim to ensure the best early care and education so that every child in Boyle and Mercer counties is <a href="https://letslearnky.org/#kindergarten-readiness">ready for kindergarten</a>.  We support collaborative community partnerships to implement evidence-based strategies that address local early childhood needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kindergarten readiness means children enter school with basic skills that will help them learn and play in the classroom. Learn more <a href="https://www.letslearnky.org/#kindergarten-readiness">here!</a>
