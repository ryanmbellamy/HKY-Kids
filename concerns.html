            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p>
            It is hard to face a concern about your child's development. Thank you for taking this first step!
</p>
<p>
            The great news is there are LOTS of resources in our community for folks who have the same concerns as you. 
   </p><p>
            If you think there could be a problem with the way your child plays, learns, speaks, acts, or moves, talk to your child’s doctor and share your concerns. Depending on your child's age, contact First Steps (ages 0-3) or your local school district (ages 3-6) for assistance at no cost to you. Another excellent resource is Kids Can Do in Danville, which provides occupational, physical and speech/language therapy as well as specialized picky eating/problem feeding, infant positioning and breastfeeding support.

                        First Steps is an early intervention program and serves children from birth to age three who have a developmental delay or a medical condition known to cause a delay. Staff provide screening and determine eligibility for services as well as coordinate services for families. Services are provided in the child's natural environment either at home, daycare or in the community. Parents and caregivers have the opportunity to learn and continue activities to promote child development.

                        When you call, say, “I am concerned about my child's development and would like to request an evaluation. Can you help me or let me speak with someone who can?”

                        When you call, say, “I have concerns about my child’s development and I would like to have my child evaluated through the school system for preschool special education services.” If the person who answers is unfamiliar with preschool special education, ask to speak with the school or district’s special education director.

                    <p>
                        If you do not know which school district to contact or need additional help, contact the state special education office.
